# Working with data structures based on lists

Condition:

It is necessary to design and develop a program in the C language that performs processing
string data, physically represented as lists.
An arbitrary number of strings of arbitrary length is entered from the input stream. Each line generally contains one or more words separated by spaces and/or tabs.
Input termination is determined by the end of the file.
Each output line is formed by modifying the original line in accordance with
requirements for individual assignments. Words in the resulting string are separated
with just one space. The source and received strings are displayed in quotes on the screen.

Task: 

Split the string into sentences by the characters ".", "!", "?" And "...". Each proposal must
start on a new line with a capital letter.
